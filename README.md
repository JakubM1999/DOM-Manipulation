<p>For this project I did one of the ideas in theme idea that I very much liked and that was: Pong video game! so I knew that I wanned to do it right away because I am a video game enthusiast so that was the perfect thing for me.</p>

<p>First what I did was to create a nice lobby or a start screen in other words, which I think looks nice and is very clean, then loading screen which is easy to do using "setTimeout" in javaScript, then some buttons and effects on them, because these buttons lead to another page where you can play this game so I needed to create another HTML, CSS and JS files to keep things seperat where the game it self is located.</p>

<p>when it came to this game it was only thing that was from tutorial video so I knew that I didn't know how to do it from scratch so I followed a tutorial but it wasn't just copy and paste I wrote the code myself and then I had many problem, bugs and errors that I had to solve myself because there wasn't any information on the internet about these specific things also I commented and explained the code best I could.</p>

<p> I learned alot by doing this project this way and I know much more about JavaScript and DOM manipulation especially how fun this is!
P.s besides the video game all of the code was created by me.</p>

<p>Hope You like it and let me know what was your score!</p>

<p>The game gets progressively harder ;)</p>
